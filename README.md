# Find-Your-Dev
The "devfinder" app, built with React.js, allows users to search for Github profiles by entering a username.
Once the user enters a valid Github username, the app retrieves the relevant information from the Github API and displays it in an easy-to-read format. This information includes the user's profile picture, bio, number of followers and more.

The idea for this project was inspired by Frontend Mentor but I developed it solely by myself.
